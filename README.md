## Cortexi- Final Capstone Project
Create a full-stack MERN web application using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
Cortexi is a cognitive tracker that monitors, enhances and maintains brain health.

## Features
Cortexi currently includes:

  - A Community Blog Center
     - Individuals can share new discoveries, share personal stories, and learn breaking scientific news.
     - Read and comment on others' posts to foster community learning and support. 

Coming soon:

  - Cognitive Assessment 
     - Stroop Effect test to assess cognitive performance. 
     - Receive a baseline score to begin tracking your overall cognitive function(clarity, focus and reaction time).
  - Progress Tracker
     - View performace trends via charts and dashboards. 
     - Monitor improvement or decline over time.


## Questions for Guidance
Did you deliver a project that met all of the technical requirements?
Given what the class has covered, did you build something reasonably complex?
Did you add a personal touch or a creative element into your project submission?
Did you deliver something of value to the end-user (not just a login button and an index page)?
Did you follow the code style guidance, and exercise best practices?
Did you provide an appropriate level of comments?
Did you try to deploy your application to a public URL as a personal stretch goal?
